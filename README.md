Welcome to ReType — an automated typing assistant!

What does it do?  
- It takes the text YOU provide and types it out slowly, just like a real person would.  
- Adds small delays between keystrokes to mimic natural typing rhythm.  
- Can be enhanced to simulate *human mistakes* and automatic corrections!  

Why use it?  
Typing repetitive or long text can be boring and time-consuming.  
ReType makes it effortless by automating the typing process, saving your fingers and time.  

How does it work?  
You enter your text, click start, and after a short delay, ReType begins typing wherever your cursor is focused.  
This allows you to paste or write in any text box — from documents to chat windows.
